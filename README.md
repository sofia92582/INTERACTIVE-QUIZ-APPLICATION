DESCRIPTION
Sure! Here's a **500-word simple and clear description** for **Task 1: Quiz Application** for your internship:

---

 The goal of this task is to help you understand how to create a simple web app that responds to user input, displays dynamic content, and gives feedback based on actions. This is a great exercise to strengthen your understanding of JavaScript and improve your front-end development skills.

The quiz application should display a set of questions, each with multiple answer choices. When a user selects an answer, the app should immediately show whether the selected answer is correct or not. This feedback helps users learn and stay engaged. As the user continues answering questions, the application should keep track of their score. At the end of the quiz, the final score should be displayed clearly, letting the user know how well they did.

To make the app more useful and flexible, the questions should be stored in a list (like an array or JSON format) and loaded into the app one by one. This way, you can easily update or add new questions later without changing the entire structure of your code. It’s also important to include a “Restart” or “Try Again” button that lets users retake the quiz from the beginning.

Visually, the quiz should be **responsive**, meaning it should work well on both mobile devices and desktop screens. Use **CSS** to style your app with attractive buttons, clear text, and a layout that adjusts based on screen size. A clean and simple user interface will make your application look more professional.

From a coding perspective, use **JavaScript** to control the quiz logic—like showing the next question, checking if an answer is right or wrong, updating the score, and managing the flow from start to finish. Make sure your code is well-structured and includes comments to explain how different parts work. This is helpful for others who read your code and for your own learning.
